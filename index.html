            <p>
              Hi! Thanks for playing Downfall, and for clicking on this. We're glad you enjoyed this project. The Steam release of Downfall doesn't support other mods, but this guide will help you get set up to play it and any other mods you desire in your base Slay the Spire game.  There is no difference between Downfall's Steam version and the Workshop version, except for additional configuration options.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div id="about" class="content-region hide">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              First, head to your Steam Library and click on Slay the Spire.  Then, click the Workshop link. 
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial1.png">
           
            <p>
              Next, search for 'downfall expansion' in the mod search bar.
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial2.png">
            
            <p>
              Click on the 'Downfall Expansion Mod' link. 
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial3.png">
            
            <h2>Subscribing to mods</h2>
            <p>
              Within the Workshop page for Downfall, click on Subscribe.  "Subscribe" is the Workshop's term for 'download and install, and keep this mod updated until I Unsubscribe."
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial4.png">
            <p>
              This will bring up a list of prerequisite mods that also need to be Subscribed to.  Start by clicking the first one, ModTheSpire.
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial5.png">
            <p>
              In the new window for ModTheSpire, click on Subscribe.  Then, close the additional window to go back to Downfall's page.
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial6.png">
            <p>
              Repeat this process for BaseMod and STSLib.  Click each one, and then click Subscribe within their new windows.
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial7.png">
            <p>
              When all three have been Subscribed, click Continue.  Downfall will now be Subscribed.
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial8.png">
            
            
            <h2>Playing Modded</h2>
            <p>
              To launch the game using Mods, go to your Steam Library, click on Slay the Spire, then click the Play button. NOTE: Activating Slay the Spire through a desktop shortcut will not allow you to play modded, it must be launched using Steam's library in some fashion.
         
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial9.png">">
            
            <p>
              In the popup window, click the 'Play with Mods' bubble, then click Play.
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial10.png">">
            
            <p>
              This new window is the Slay the Spire Mod Launcher, known as ModTheSpire or MTS for short.  In this window, click the checkbox for each of the three mods you have Subscribed to - BaseMod, STSLib, and Downfall.  Checking a box indicates you wish to launch Slay the Spire with a particular mod enabled.  With all three checked, click the Play button.
            </p>
            
      <img src="tutorial11.png">
       
           
            <p>
              That's it!  Slay the Spire should now be launching with Downfall enabled. </p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <p>   
              <ul>
                <li><b>Can I transfer save files from the Steam version to the Workshop version?</b> Yes! In your Downfall install directory (right click in Steam Library, Browse local files) find the preferences directory.  Copy everything in that folder to your Slay the Spire directory.  This also works in the inverse, if you wish to transfer your Slay the Spire saves to Downfall.  However, there is no way to cleanly merge the two.</li>
                <li><b>Does playing modded use a different save file?</b> Nope! The Save files for main game are still used when playing modded, so you don't have to lose any progress.</li>
                <li><b>Why can't I earn achievements when playing modded?</b> This is an intentional decision made by MegaCrit to prevent abuse to unlock achievements instantly. However, this can be overwritten with another mod (see recommended mod list).</li>
                <li><b>Can I donate to the Downfall project?</b> We do not accept any monetary donations of any kind, though we appreciate how often we get asked this. If you'd like to support us, just keep an eye out for announcements from various Downfall team members in Discord when other projects from them can receive support.</li>
                <li><b>Can I contribute something to Downfall?</b> Absolutely! Downfall's source code is public and the team itself is as well. We accept any new contributors to our Discord and will gladly welcome new members who want to get involved with providing code, art, or other support.</li>
