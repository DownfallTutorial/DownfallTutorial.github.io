    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4"> Hi! Thanks for playing Downfall, and for clicking on this. We're glad you enjoyed this project. The Steam release of Downfall doesn't support other mods, but this guide will help you get set up to play it and any other mods you desire in your base Slay the Spire game.  There is no difference between Downfall's Steam version and the Workshop version, except for additional configuration options.
    </div>
<br>
		  
    <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold">Getting Started</h1>
    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4"> First, head to your Steam Library and click on Slay the Spire.  Then, click the Workshop link.

               <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold">FAQ</h1>

 <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">

              <ul>
                <li><b>Can I transfer save files from the Steam version to the Workshop version?</b> Yes! In your Downfall install directory (right click in Steam Library, Browse local files) find the preferences directory.  Copy everything in that folder to your Slay the Spire directory.  This also works in the inverse, if you wish to transfer your Slay the Spire saves to Downfall.  However, there is no way to cleanly merge the two.</li>
                <li><b>Does playing modded use a different save file?</b> Nope! The Save files for main game are still used when playing modded, so you don't have to lose any progress.</li>
                <li><b>Why can't I earn achievements when playing modded?</b> This is an intentional decision made by MegaCrit to prevent abuse to unlock achievements instantly. However, this can be overwritten with another mod (see recommended mod list).</li>
                <li><b>Can I donate to the Downfall project?</b> We do not accept any monetary donations of any kind, though we appreciate how often we get asked this. If you'd like to support us, just keep an eye out for announcements from various Downfall team members in Discord when other projects from them can receive support.</li>
                <li><b>Can I contribute something to Downfall?</b> Absolutely! Downfall's source code is public and the team itself is as well. We accept any new contributors to our <a href=https://discord.gg/GFe2Tr4kh9>Discord</a> and will gladly welcome new members who want to get involved with providing code, art, or other support.</li>
  <li><b>I have another question not answered here.</b> Join our <a href=https://discord.gg/GFe2Tr4kh9>Discord</a> to ask the team members and other players.</li>
